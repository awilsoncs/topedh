<a id="about-magic-the-gathering" class="anchor" href="#about-magic-the-gathering" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Magic the Gathering</h2>

<p>Magic: The Gathering (MTG; also known as Magic) is a trading card game created by Richard Garfield.</p>

<p>First published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast, Magic was the first trading card game produced and it continues to thrive, with approximately twenty million players as of 2015. Magic can be played by two or more players in various formats, the most common of which uses a deck of 60+ cards, either in person with printed cards or using a deck of virtual cards through the Internet-based Magic: The Gathering Online, on a smartphone or tablet, or other programs.</p>

<p>Each game represents a battle between wizards known as "planeswalkers", who employ spells, artifacts, and creatures depicted on individual Magic cards to defeat their opponents. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the gameplay of Magic bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games, while having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games.</p>

<p>New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. An organized tournament system played at an international level and a worldwide community of professional Magic players has developed, as well as a substantial secondary market for Magic cards. Certain Magic cards can be valuable due to their rarity and utility in gameplay. Prices range from a few cents to thousands of dollars.</p>

<a id="about-the-commander-format" class="anchor" href="#about-the-commander-format" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the Commander Format</h2>

<p>Created and popularized by fans, the Commander (also known as "EDH") variant is usually played in casual Free-for-All multiplayer games, although two-player games are also popular. Each player's deck is headed by a legendary creature (a character within the game world) designated as that deck's commander. A player's choice of commander determines which other cards can be played in the deck (while except for basic lands, each card in the deck must have a different name).</p>

<a id="about-topedh" class="anchor" href="#about-topedh" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About TopEDH</h2>

<p>TopEDH is a report designed to assist Commander players in purchasing decisions. By combining pricing data and decklists, we look at a "decks/dollar" metric called "Value". In other words, how many unique decks (one per commander) would a player want to put this card in, divided by how much they will pay for the card. In this way, players can optimize their purchasing to fill as many slots as possible within a budget. </p>

<a id="a-note-about-power-level" class="anchor" href="#a-note-about-power-level" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Note About Power Level</h3>

<p>While the "power" of a card is difficult to quantify, one might suspect that the occurences of a card in decks indicates its gameplay value. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not the case. By direct observation, an expert can see that functionally similar but stronger cards sometimes appear at lower occurences. We suspect this relates to age, release count, and presence on the Reserved List, and prevelance of play in other formats. Further analysis may incorporate these factors to optimize for quality of card purchases in addition to quantity. </p>

<p><b>Occurences</b>: The number of commanders among decks in which this card often sees play. By measuring a card based on which decks it can be found, we neutralize the effect of commander popularity on a card's rating in this list. Otherwise, cards played with popular commanders would be artificially inflated.</p>

<p>Occurences were scraped from edhrec.com using Beautiful Soup.</p>

<p>Here we define <b>playable value</b> to be occurences divided by price. Or, in other words "decks per dollar". Price has been adjusted from the mid value found at dawnglare.com. Cards without a listed price are assumed to be $0.50, which could be wildly incorrect. These cards are relatively cheap and played in many decks. Price Data was accessed on 6/5/2016.</p>
